  "description": "\n        <p></p><ol class=\"ExDetail-descriptionSteps\"><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">  Position a pair of light-weight dumbbells in front of you, parallel to each other. Keeping your back flat, bend forward and squat down, grasping the dumbbells. This is your start position.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Initiate the movement by kicking one leg back, then the other so that you&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;re in the push-up position, holding onto the dumbbells. Your weight should be on your toes and hands. Do a one-arm row for each side, bringing your elbow up as high as you can.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Hop your feet forward and rise up by cleaning the weights, bringing them up to shoulder level, palms facing forward as you hop a second time. Descend into a squat and explosively rise up, then press the weights overhead to full arm extension.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Lower the dumbbells back to your shoulders, then bend over as you squat down to return the weights back to the floor in front of you. Repeat for reps.</li></ol><p></p>\n      "
