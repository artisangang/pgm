  "description": "\n        <p></p><ol class=\"ExDetail-descriptionSteps\"><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Lie face down with your whole body straight on a flat bench while holding a weight plate behind your head.  <strong>Tip:</strong> You will need to position yourself so that your shoulders are slightly above the end of a flat bench in order for the upper chest, neck and face to be off the bench.  This will be your starting position.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> While keeping the plate secure on the back of your head slowly lower your head (as in saying yes) as you breathe in.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Raise your head back up to the starting position in a semi-circular motion as you breathe out.  Hold the contraction for a second.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</li></ol><p></p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> As with all exercises, refrain from using any sort of sudden or jerking motions.</p><p><strong>Variation:</strong> You can opt to use no resistance at first.</p>\n      "
