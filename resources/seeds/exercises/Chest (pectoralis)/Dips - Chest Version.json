To get yourself into the starting position, hold your body at arms length (arms locked) above the bars.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">While breathing in, lower yourself slowly with your torso leaning forward around 30 degrees or so and your elbows flared out slightly until you feel a slight stretch in the chest.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Once you feel the stretch, use your chest to bring your body back to the starting position as you breathe out. Tip: Remember to squeeze the chest at the top of the movement for a second.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.</li></ol><p></p><p><strong>Variations:</strong></p><p>If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a dip assist machine if available.  These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.</p><p>Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.</p><p>More advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.</p>\n      "
