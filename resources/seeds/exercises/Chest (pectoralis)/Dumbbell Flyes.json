  "description": "\n        <p></p><ol class=\"ExDetail-descriptionSteps\"><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell on each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Then using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells, lift the dumbbells one at a time so you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width with the palms of your hands facing each other.  Raise the dumbbells up like you&apos;re pressing them, but stop and hold just before you lock out. This will be your starting position.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest.  Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.  <strong>Tip:</strong> Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out.  <strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.</li></ol><p></p><p><strong>Variations:</strong> You may want to use a palms facing forward version for different stimulation.</p>\n      "
