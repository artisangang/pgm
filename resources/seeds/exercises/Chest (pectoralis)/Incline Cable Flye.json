  "description": "\n        <p></p><ol class=\"ExDetail-descriptionSteps\"><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> To get yourself into the starting position, set the pulleys at the floor level (lowest level possible on the machine that is below your torso).</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Place an incline bench (set at 45 degrees) in between the pulleys, select a weight on each one and grab a pulley on each hand.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> With a handle on each hand, lie on the incline bench and bring your hands together at arms length in front of your face.  This will be your starting position.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> With a slight bend of your elbows (in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon), lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest.  Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.  <strong>Tip:</strong> Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary.  The movement should only occur at the shoulder joint.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and exhale.  Hold the contracted position for a second.  <strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.</li></ol><p></p><p><strong>Variation:</strong> You can vary the angle of the bench in order to target the upper chest at slightly different angles.</p>\n      "
