Move cable to highest pulley position.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Stand with side to cable. With one hand, reach up and grab handle with underhand grip.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Pull down cable until elbow touches your side and the handle is by your shoulder.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Position feet hip-width apart. Place free hand on hip to help gauge pivot point.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Keep arm in static position. Contract oblique to bring the weight down in a side crunch.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Once you reach maximum contraction, slowly release the weight to the starting position. The weight stack should never be unloaded in a resting position. The aim is constant tension during the set.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Repeat to failure.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Then, reposition and repeat the same series of movements on the opposite side.</li></ol>Tip: Keep your arm tucked in tight to your side; don&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;t move it. This technique will ensure the weight is isolated directly to the obliques and not your biceps or shoulder.<p></p>\n      "
