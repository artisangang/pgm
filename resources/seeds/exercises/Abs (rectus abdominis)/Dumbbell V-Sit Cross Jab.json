  "description": "\n        <p></p><ol class=\"ExDetail-descriptionSteps\"><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Begin seated on your butt with your knees bent and feet on the ground. Lean your upper body back to form a 45-degree angle with the floor. Bring your feet off the ground so that your body resembles a V shape. </li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Grasp a dumbbell in each hand and hold tight to your chest with palms facing each other. This will be your starting position. </li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> While keeping your core tight and maintaining your body&apos;s V position, quickly extend your left arm straight out (similar to a jab) and then bring it back to the starting position while simultaneously punching out with the right arm. </li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Your torso and legs may slightly rotate side to side opposite of your hands throughout the movement&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201D;this is okay.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> A punch with each hand counts as one total repetition. Repeat for recommended number of repetitions.  </li></ol><p></p>\n      "
