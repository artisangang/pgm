This will be your starting position.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Start the movement by lifting the left leg higher than the right leg.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Then lower the left leg as you lift the right leg.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Continue alternating in this manner (as though you are doing a flutter kick in water) until you have done the recommended amount of repetitions for each leg. Make sure that you keep a controlled movement at all times. <strong>Tip:</strong> You will breathe normally as you perform this movement.</li></ol><p></p><p><strong>Variations:</strong> As you get more advanced you can use ankle weights.</p>\n      "
