This can be done inside of a power rack to make unracking easier.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Sit back with your hips until your glutes touch your feet, keeping your head and chest up. </li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Explode up with your hips, generating enough power to land with your feet flat on the floor. </li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Continue with the squat by driving through your heels and extending the knees to come to a standing position.</li></ol><p></p>\n      "
