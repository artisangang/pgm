Your head should be looking forward and the bend of the knees should create a 90-degree angle between the hamstrings and the calves. This will be your starting position.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> As you exhale, lift up your right leg until the hamstrings are in line with the back while maintaining the 90-degree angle bend. Contract the glutes throughout this movement and hold the contraction at the top for a second.  <strong>Tip:</strong> At the end of the movement the upper leg should be parallel to the floor while the calf should be perpendicular to it.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Go back to the initial position as you inhale and now repeat with the left leg.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Continue to alternate legs until all of the recommended repetitions have been performed.</li></ol><p></p><p><strong>Variations:</strong>  For this exercise you can also perform all of the repetitions with one leg first and then the other one.  Additionally, you can also add ankle weights.</p>\n      "
