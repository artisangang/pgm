  "description": "\n        <p></p><ol class=\"ExDetail-descriptionSteps\"><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Begin standing with a barbell close to your shins. Your feet should be directly under your hips with your feet turned out slightly. Grip the bar with a double overhand grip or hook grip, about shoulder width apart. Squat down to the bar. Your spine should be in full extension, with a back angle that places your shoulders in front of the bar and your back as vertical as possible. </li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Begin by driving through the floor through the front of your heels. As the bar travels upward, maintain a constant back angle. Flare your knees out to the side to help keep them out of the bar&apos;s path. </li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">After the bar crosses the knees, complete the lift by driving the hips into the bar until your hips and knees are extended.</li></ol><p></p>\n      "
