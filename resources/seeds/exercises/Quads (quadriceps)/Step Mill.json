  "description": "\n        <p></p><ol class=\"ExDetail-descriptionSteps\"><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">To begin, step onto the stepmill and select the desired option from the menu. You can choose a manual setting, or you can select a program to run. Typically, you can enter your age and weight to estimate the amount of calories burned during exercise. Use caution so that you don&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;t trip as you climb the stairs. It is recommended that you maintain your grip on the handles so that you don&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;t fall. </li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Stepmills offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and usually have less impact than running outside while offering a similar rate of calories burned. They are typically much harder than other cardio equipment. A 150 lb person will typically burn over 300 calories in 30 minutes, compared to about 175 calories walking. </li></ol><p></p>\n      "
