  "description": "\n        <p></p><ol class=\"ExDetail-descriptionSteps\"><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">  Begin in a standing position with a dumbbell in each hand. Your arms should be hanging at your sides with your palms facing forward. Look directly ahead, keeping your chest up, with your feet shoulder-width apart. This will be your starting position.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Initiate the movement by flexing the elbows to curl the weight. Do not use momentum or flex through the shoulder, instead use a controlled motion. </li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Execute the pressing movement by extending the arm, flexing and abducting the shoulder to rotate the arm as you press above your head. </li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Pause at the top of the motion before reversing the movement to return to the starting position. Complete the desired number of repetitions before switching to the opposite side.</li></ol><p></p>\n      "
