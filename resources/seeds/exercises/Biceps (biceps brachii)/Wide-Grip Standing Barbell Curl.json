  "description": "\n        <p></p><ol class=\"ExDetail-descriptionSteps\"><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Stand up with your torso upright while holding a barbell at the wide outer handle.  The palm of your hands should be facing forward.  The elbows should be close to the torso. This will be your starting position.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out.  <strong>Tip:</strong> Only the forearms should move.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level.  Hold the contracted position for a second and squeeze the biceps hard.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Slowly begin to bring the bar back to starting position as your breathe in.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</li></ol><p></p> <p><strong>Variations:</strong></p><p></p><ul><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> You can also perform this movement using an E-Z bar or E-Z attachment hooked to a low pulley.  This variation seems to really provide a good contraction at the top of the movement.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> You may also use the closer grip for variety purposes.</li></ul><p></p>\n      "
