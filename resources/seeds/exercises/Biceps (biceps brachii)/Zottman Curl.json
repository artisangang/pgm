The elbows should be close to the torso.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Make sure the palms of the hands are facing each other.  This will be your starting position.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the weights while contracting the biceps as you breathe out.  Only the forearms should move.  Your wrist should rotate so that you have a supinated (palms up) grip.  Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Now during the contracted position, rotate your wrist until you now have a pronated (palms facing down) grip with the thumb at a higher position than the pinky.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back down using the pronated grip.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> As the dumbbells close your thighs, start rotating the wrist so that you go back to a neutral (palms facing your body) grip.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</li></ol><p></p>\n      "
