  "description": "\n        <p></p><ol class=\"ExDetail-descriptionSteps\"><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Hold the dumbbell towards the side farther from you so that you have more weight on the side closest to you. (This can be done for a good effect on all bicep dumbbell exercises). Now do a normal incline dumbbell curl, but keep your wrists as far back as possible so as to neutralize any stress that is placed on them.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Sit on an incline bench that is angled at 45-degrees while holding a dumbbell on each hand.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Let your arms hang down on your sides, with the elbows in, and turn the palms of your hands forward with the thumbs pointing away from the body.  <strong>Tip:</strong> You will keep this hand position throughout the movement as there should not be any twisting of the hands as they come up.  This will be your starting position.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Curl up the two dumbbells at the same time until your biceps are fully contracted and exhale. <strong>Tip:</strong> Do not swing the arms or use momentum.  Keep a controlled motion at all times.  Hold the contracted position for a second at the top.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">As you inhale, slowly go back to the starting position.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</li></ol><p></p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> Do not extend your arms totally as you could injure your elbows if you hyperextend them.  Also, make sure that on the way down you move slowly to avoid injury.</p><p><strong>Variations:</strong> You can use cables for this movement as well.</p>\n      "
