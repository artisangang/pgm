This will be your starting position.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> As you breathe out, externally rotate your forearm so that the dumbbell is lifted forward as you maintain the 90 degree angle bend between the upper arms and the forearm.  You will continue this external rotation until the forearm is parallel to the floor.  At this point you will hold the contraction for a second.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> As you breathe in, slowly go back to the starting position.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</li></ol><p></p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> There is no need to go heavy with this exercise.
