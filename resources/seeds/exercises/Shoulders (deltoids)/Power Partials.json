  "description": "\n        <p></p><ol class=\"ExDetail-descriptionSteps\"><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell on each hand being held at arms length.  The elbows should be close to the torso.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> The palms of the hands should be facing your torso.  Your feet should be about shoulder width apart. This will be your starting position.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Keeping your arms straight and the torso stationary, lift the weights out to your sides until they are about shoulder level height while exhaling.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Feel the contraction for a second and begin to lower the weights back down to the starting position while inhaling. <strong>Tip:</strong> Keep the palms facing down with the little finger slightly higher while lifting and lowering the weights as it will concentrate the stress on your shoulders mainly.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</li></ol><p></p><p><strong>Variations:</strong> There are many possible variations for this movement.  For instance, you can perform the exercise sitting down on a bench with or without back support and you can also perform it by alternating arms; first lift the right arm for one repetition, then the left, then the right, etc.</p>\n      "
