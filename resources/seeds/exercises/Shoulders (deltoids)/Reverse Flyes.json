Have the dumbbells in each hand with the palms facing each other (neutral grip).</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Extend the arms in front of you so that they are perpendicular to the angle of the bench.  The legs should be stationary while applying pressure with the ball of your toes.  This is the starting position.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Maintaining the slight bend of the elbows, move the weights out and away from each other (to the side) in an arc motion while exhaling. <strong>Tip:</strong> Try to squeeze your shoulder blades together to get the best results from this exercise.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> The arms should be elevated until they are parallel to the floor.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Feel the contraction and slowly lower the weights back down to the starting position while inhaling.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</li></ol><p></p>\n      "
