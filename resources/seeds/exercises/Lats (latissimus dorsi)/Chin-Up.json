  "description": "\n        <p></p><ol class=\"ExDetail-descriptionSteps\"><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing your torso and a grip closer than the shoulder width.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, keep your torso as straight as possible while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out.  This is your starting position. <strong>Tip:</strong> Keeping the torso as straight as possible maximizes biceps stimulation while minimizing back involvement.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> As you breathe out, pull your torso up until your head is around the level of the pull-up bar.  Concentrate on using the biceps muscles in order to perform the movement.  Keep the elbows close to your body.  <strong>Tip:</strong> The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move.  The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> After a second of squeezing the biceps in the contracted position, slowly lower your torso back to the starting position; when your arms are fully extended.  Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.</li></ol><p></p><p><strong>Variations:</strong></p> <p></p><ul><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a pull-up assist machine if available.  These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> On the other hand, more advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.</li></ul><p></p>\n      "
