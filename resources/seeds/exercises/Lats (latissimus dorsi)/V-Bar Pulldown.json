  "description": "\n        <p></p><ol class=\"ExDetail-descriptionSteps\"><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Sit down on a pull-down machine with a V-Bar attached to the top pulley.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Adjust the knee pad of the machine to fit your height.  These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Grab the V-bar with the palms facing each other (a neutral grip).  Stick your chest out and lean yourself back slightly (around 30-degrees) in order to better engage the lats.  This will be your starting position.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Using your lats, pull the bar down as you squeeze your shoulder blades.  Continue until your chest nearly touches the V-bar.  Exhale as you execute this motion. <strong>Tip:</strong> Keep the torso stationary throughout the movement.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> After a second hold on the contracted position, slowly bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe in.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Repeat for the prescribed number of repetitions.</li></ol><p></p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> Avoid the temptation to use a weight so big that you need to start swinging your torso in order to perform the exercise.</p>\n      "
