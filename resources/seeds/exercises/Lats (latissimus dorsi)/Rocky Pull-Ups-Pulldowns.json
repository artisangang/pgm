  "description": "\n        <p></p><ol class=\"ExDetail-descriptionSteps\"><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing forward using a wide grip.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out.  This is your starting position.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Pull your torso up until the bar touches your upper chest by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back.  Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement. <strong>Tip:</strong> Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position.  The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move.  The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> After a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Now repeat the same movements as described above except this time your torso will remain straight as you go up and the bar will touch the back of the neck instead of the upper chest. <strong>Tip:</strong> Use the head to lean forward slightly as it will help you properly execute this portion of the exercise.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\"> Once you have lowered yourself back down to the starting position, repeat the exercise for the prescribed amount of repetitions in your program.</li></ol><p></p><p><strong>Caution:</strong> The behind the neck variation can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck so this exercise is not recommended for people with shoulder problems.</p> <p><strong>Variations:</strong></p> <p></p><ul><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a chin assist machine if available.  These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help.</li><li class=\"ExDetail-descriptionStep\">You can also use a pull-down machine.</li></ul><p></p>\n      "
